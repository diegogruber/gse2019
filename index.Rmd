- Create a user to access RStudio: `sudo adduser [user name]`

# APIs

## What is an API?

- "Application Programming Interface"
- A way for computers to talk to each other.
- Reference: [Zapier](https://zapier.com/learn/apis/)

## Why build your own API?

- Successful machine learning:
    - Academic: model fits data well, good predictive accuracy
    - Enterprise: model that fits product, integrates well with other enterprise systems
- Bridge gap between data scientists and developers
- Separation of concerns
- Rapidly pivot software features in response to end user demands
- A thoughtful [article](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/biz/api/apis-future-of-data-science/) on the subject

## HTTP

- Most APIs these days are based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, **HTTP:**.
- A **protocol** is an accepted set of rules that govern how two computers can speak to each other.
- Communication between a **host** (server) and a **client** occurs, via a **request/response pair**.

- Communication is [stateless](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13200152/why-say-that-http-is-a-stateless-protocol) (the server is not *required* to track state over multiple requests, though in practice this may be achieved by session IDs or cookies)

## Message Formats

The HTTP specification states that a request or response message has the following generic structure:

```
message = <start-line>
          *(<message-header>)
          CRLF
          [<message-body>]

<start-line> = Request-Line | Status-Line 
<message-header> = Field-Name ':' Field-Value
```

## Request

- Uniform Resource Locator (**URL**):

![](https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/authors/jeremymcpeak/http1-url-structure.png)

- **Methods** (or verbs) are actions to be performed on host:
    - GET: fetch existing resource
    - POST: create new resource
    - PUT, DELETE, others.
- **Headers** provide meta-information about a request.
- The **body** contains data the client wants to send the server. 

## Response

- **Status codes** tell the client how to interpret the server response:
    - 2xx (OK)
    - 3xx (Redirection)
    - 4xx (Client Error)
    - 5xx (Server Error)
- Response headers and body follow the same format as requests.
- Data typically returned in XML or JSON formats.

## JSON

- A very simple format that has two pieces: **keys** and **values**. 
- Keys represent an attribute about the object being described.

```
{
  "crust": "original",
  "toppings": ["cheese", "pepperoni", "garlic"],
  "status": "cooking",
  "customer": {
    "name": "Brian",
    "phone": "573-111-1111"
  }
}
```

- If given the choice, choose JSON over XML.

## Consuming APIs

Example:

- Install package `httr` (a Python equivalent would be the `requests`library)
- Use a geocoding API such as LocationIQ to retrieve longitude and latitude for Barcelona or any other location

Exercise:

- Sign up for [Dark Sky weather API](https://darksky.net/dev/).
- Retrieve current weather for the location you used in the example

# Building analytic applications

## Good practices in software development

- Promote a friendly development environment and encourage collaboration
- Help avoid terrible mistakes
- Encourage reuse
- Reduce complexity, reducing the knowledge gap for new developers
- Avoid conflict
- Reduce the load on engineering & operations
- Improve deliverability and maintainability
- Make the customer happy

*You are losing the freedom to do whatever you want with your code, but it's a price worth paying!*

## Software projects

- **A software project in the programming language X is a series of files and folders arranged in a standardized way** (e.g. Python or R packages)
- To create an R Package, install packages `usethis` and `devtools`
- Run `usethis::create_package("[your pkg name]")`

## Functions

- The goal is to hide complexity
- Functions are the most basic construction for code reuse
- They encapsulate a data transformation
    - Input arguments come in => Output values come out
- Name them accordingly! Roughly: use verbs for functions, nouns for inputs/outputs
    - `download_data` is a decent function name
    - `project_data` is an awful function name
- Follow coding conventions, do not mix coding styles within a package!
- Functions live in the `R/` folder. `usethis::use_r("[function name]")`

## Source control

- Lets you track changes to your code, restore previous versions
- Keep backups in a remote repository 
- Create multiple development branches: master (production/stable branch), development (beta branch), feature branches (experiment with new ideas), etc. 
- Move changes to a more stable branch when they're ready
- Source control fosters collaboration!
- The most popular tool for source control nowadays is git
- `usethis::use_git()`

## Documentation

**It's about guaranteeing your functions are properly understood and used, checking that what you do makes sense**

- Document functions with roxygen comments (`#'`) in R (docstrings in Python)
- Install `roxygen2`. Insert roxygen skeleton for your function and fill-in the details, for example:
    - `@param` to describe function inputs
    - `@return` to describe function outputs
    - `@import` to list function dependencies
    - `@export` if your function should be visible to the end user
- `devtools::document()` generates help files in `man/`. View them with `help()`
- Vignettes are a different kind of documentation: long-form guides to your package. Also quite important! `usethis::use_vignette()`

## Unit testing

Tests prevent serious trauma: With the customer / Within the team.

- Install `testthat`
- `usethis::use_test("[test name]")`
- Tests live in `test/`
- Run `devtools::test()`
- Source control + automated unit testing = Continuos Integration! 
- Determine coverage with `covr::package_coverage()`

**Higher test coverage means more peace of mind to evolve your project, giving you confidence you won't break things that work!**

## Dependency management

Add dependencies to your DESCRIPTION file with `usethis::use_package()`. 

To track specific versions of your dependencies: 

- Install `packrat` in R
- Track dependencies with `packrat::snapshot()`
- Restore dependencies with `packrat::restore()`
- Conda or pip environments in Python

To go beyond managing R package dependencies, consider Docker.

## OpenCPU

- The [OpenCPU](https://www.opencpu.org/) server provides a reliable API for data analysis based on R.
- Compatible with any language or framework that speaks HTTP.
- Uses **standard R packaging** to develop, ship and deploy web applications.
- Support for parallel computing and asynchronous requests.
- Can be used, modified and redistributed for both for open source and proprietary projects.

## Launch your API

- [Install OpenCPU](https://www.opencpu.org/download.html)
<!-- - Install `opencpu` package -->
<!-- - Type `opencpu::opencpu$start()` to start the API. -->
<!-- - Type `opencpu::opencpu$browse()` to test it. -->
- Open port 80 (or 8004) to share your API with others
- Endpoint: 

`{url}/ocpu/user/{username}/library/{pkgname}/R/{function}/{format}`

- Send a POST request using your function's parameters

## A Simple Interface

- You can include a UI in your package's inst/www directory.
- See examples at [OpenCPU Apps](https://www.opencpu.org/apps.html)
- Install the `opencpu` package
- Run one of the example packages directly from Github: `opencpu::ocpu_start_app("rwebapps/nabel")`

## Homework!

- Create a simple package in R with one or two basic functions
- Make sure your functions are well documented and have unit tests
- Push your project to a Github repo and send me the link

Choose one of thw following options:

- One of your functions should download data from a free API (not LocationIQ or DarkSky, sorry). If the API requires a token, do not include it in your code! Send me the key by email so I can test your function
- Launch an API server for your package. Send me a URL where I can test your API. I'll try it out asap and let you know when you can shut it down
